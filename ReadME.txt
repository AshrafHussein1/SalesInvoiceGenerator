This project is a Java-based desktop application "Sales Invoice Generator" created using Java programming language.
A sales invoice is an accounting document that records a business transaction. It provides the business with a record of the services they’ve provided to a client, when the services were rendered and how much money the client owes the business.

Typically, a sales invoice will include a description of the service provided and the amount owed. Sales invoices are crucial to small-business accounting because they enable you to record transactions of your sales for bookkeeping purposes.

This application is created to help our customers (Businesses) automatically generate and retain the history of transactions the business has.
